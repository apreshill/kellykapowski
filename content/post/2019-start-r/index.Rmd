Who knew? Data science is trendy, and I'm looking to get into it. See, look- I'm already DOING data science right here:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
oplot <- ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, 
                   y = circumference, 
                   colour = Tree)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#EAE7D6", colour = NA))
oplot
```

Gotta say- I love these viridis palettes. I think magma is my favorite! Here is a markdown image inserted using `![](magma.jpg)`

I also sometimes use `knitr` for this kind of thing too:

```{r out.width='25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("magma.jpg")
```

As you can tell from my [bio](../../#about), I like fun colors.
