Kelly Kapowski was the most popular girl in school and was head cheerleader and captain of the volleyball, swim, and softball teams. Though a good student and role model, Kelly did find herself punished with detention on a couple of occasions. She also was the love interest of lead student Zack Morris. They were an on/off couple in high school and then they remained friends afterwards and married later. ([read more](https://savedbythebell.fandom.com/wiki/Kelly_Kapowski))
